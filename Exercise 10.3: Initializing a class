'''
In the third exercise we make one final adjustment to the class by adding initialization data and a docstring. First add a docstring "Player-class: stores data on team colors and points.". After this, add an initializing method __init__ to the class, and make it prompt the user for a new player color with the message"What color do I get?: ".

class player():
	"""Player-class: stores data on team colors and points."""
	
	def __init__(self,teamcolor, points =0):
		self.teamcolor = teamcolor
		self.points = points
		
	def tellscores(self):
		print("I am ", self.teamcolor , ", we have ", self.points ,"points!")

	def goal(self):
		self.points += 1
	
def main():
	color1 = input("What color do I get?: ")
	player1 = player(color1)
	color2  = input("What color do I get?: ")
	player2= player(color2)
	player1.goal()
	player1.goal()
	player2.goal()
	player1.tellscores()
	player2.tellscores()
	
if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
